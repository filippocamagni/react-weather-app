# react-weather-app
A simple, responsive weather app I built with React.js, TypeScript, and the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api). 

It features animated weather icons and a dynamic background.

The custom SVG weather icons were imported from [amcharts.com](https://amcharts.com). All the other icons come from the [react-icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/) library (Font Awesome, Ant Design, Weather).

Here's a [demo](http://fc-react-weather-app.netlify.app).
